House Price Prediction Dataset is to develop a system that can automatically estimate the selling prices of houses based on various input features. This type of predictive model can be valuable for real estate professionals, homeowners, and potential buyers by providing insights into the factors that influence house prices.

Interpretation:

Predictive Modeling:
The task involves creating a predictive model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm trained on historical data to make predictions about future outcomes.
In this context, the model will be trained on features such as the size of the house, location, number of bedrooms, etc., to predict the sale price.
House Price Prediction Dataset:
The dataset chosen for this task contains relevant information about houses, including various features (independent variables) and the sale prices (dependent variable).
The dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning model.
Input Features:
Input features are the characteristics or attributes of the houses that the model will use to make predictions.
Examples of features may include square footage, number of bedrooms, location, presence of amenities, etc.
Target Variable:
The target variable is the variable that the model aims to predict. In this case, it is the sale price of the house.
The model will learn patterns and relationships within the input features to make accurate predictions of the target variable.
Model Evaluation:
The success of the machine learning model will be evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict house prices.
Common evaluation metrics include mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared, which measure the difference between predicted and actual prices.
