It seems like your logistic regression model is performing exceptionally well on the test set, achieving perfect accuracy (1.00). This could be a sign of overfitting, especially if your dataset is relatively small. It's essential to be cautious about such high accuracy, as it might not generalize well to new, unseen data.
Now, let's analyze the model coefficients to understand the importance of different features. The coefficients indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between each feature and the target variable. Positive coefficients contribute positively to the prediction, while negative coefficients contribute negatively.
