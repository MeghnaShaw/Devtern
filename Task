Task 1:Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression.
Objective: The objective of this task is to build a logistic regression model to predict the risk of heart disease in patients.
Prepare the dataset for machine learning. This includes cleaning the data, removing missing values, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
Build a logistic regression model to predict the risk of heart disease.
Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set.
Analyze the model coefficients to understand the importance of the different features.
